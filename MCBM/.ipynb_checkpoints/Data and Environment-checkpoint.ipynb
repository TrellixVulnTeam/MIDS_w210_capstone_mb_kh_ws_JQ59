    "The easiest data sources to start with seem to be GTZAN and FMA, since they have both audio and some metadata available. With FMA we should have enough data to train a reasonably complicated model. For a final product, figuring out how to read music from Youtube and/or Spotify seems like the only way this actually gets used by real people. Also, the sooner we figure that out, the more training data we have."
